# Module 3: Search & Aggregations üîçüìä

**Goal:** Master Elasticsearch's powerful search and aggregation capabilities.

## 3.1. Query DSL Deep Dive:

Covered in [Beginner‚Äôs Crash Course to Elastic Stack - Part 3: Full text queries](https://youtu.be/2KgJ6TQPIIA)

* **Queries vs. Filters:** Understanding the difference and when to use each.

    * [Queries and filters](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-filter-context)

* **Term-level queries:** `term`, `terms`, `range`, `exists`, `prefix`.

    * [term level queries](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/term-level-queries.html)

        * [term query](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-dsl-term-query): returns documents that contain **an exact** term in a provided field. Useful when you have to lookup for an ID or some kind of specific value.

            <blockquote class="warning">

            **Do not use** term queries for `text` fields. By default, Elasticsearch changes the value of a give `text` field during the analysis process but the `term` search **does not** analyze the search term. 
            
            Use `match` query instead.    
            </blockquote>
        
        * [terms query](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-dsl-terms-query): same that `term` query except you can search for multiple values

        * [range query](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-dsl-range-query)

        * [exists query](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-dsl-exists-query): returns documents that contains an indexed value for a given field. Pretty useful when you want to filter out results where the value of a given field can be empty or null.

        * [prefix query](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-dsl-prefix-query): returns documents that contain a specific prefix in a provided field.

* **Full-text queries:** `match`, `match_phrase`, `multi_match`, `query_string`.

    [Beginner‚Äôs Crash Course to Elastic Stack - Part 3: Full text queries](https://youtu.be/2KgJ6TQPIIA?t=1089)

    * [full-text queries](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/full-text-queries) 

        * [match query](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-dsl-match-query): this is one of the most used search queries. The `query` parameter, by default, will use an `OR` clause for every term in the query. For instance, a query value of `capital of Hungary` is interpreted as `capital OR of OR Hungary`.

            [Beginner‚Äôs Crash Course to Elastic Stack - Part 3: Full text queries # match query](https://youtu.be/2KgJ6TQPIIA?t=1088)

        * [match_phrase query](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-dsl-match-query-phrase): all terms must be present in the document, and they must appear in the exact order specified, and be contiguous.

            [Beginner‚Äôs Crash Course to Elastic Stack - Part 3: Full text queries # match_phrase query](https://youtu.be/2KgJ6TQPIIA?t=1287)

            <blockquote class="warning">

            **match + AND != match_phrase** 
            
            In `match_phrase` all the terms **must be included in the document**, **they must appear in the exact order specified**, and **be contiguous**. On the other hand, `match` using `AND` **is not equivalent to** `match_phrase` because even all the terms must be included in the document, **their order and proximity do not matter**. It will find all the documents where all those words are present regardless of the arrangement.
            
            </blockquote>

        * [multi_match query](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-dsl-multi-match-query): it allows to use a `match` query against multiple fields.
            
            [Beginner‚Äôs Crash Course to Elastic Stack - Part 3: Full text queries # muti_match query](https://youtu.be/2KgJ6TQPIIA?t=1418)
            

* **Compound queries:** `bool` (must, should, must_not, filter), `constant_score`.


* **Joining queries** (nested, has_child, has_parent - if applicable to your use cases).

## 3.2. Analyzers and Mappings

All data types [here](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/field-data-types).

* How text is analyzed (tokenizers, token filters, character filters).
* Standard analyzer vs. other built-in analyzers.
* Defining custom analyzers.
* Explicit mapping: Defining data types, indexing options (`analyzed`, `not_analyzed` - now `text` and `keyword`).
    * [text vs keyword. From min 13:15 onwards](https://www.youtube.com/live/FQAHDrVwfok?t=795)
    * [`store` fields](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/mapping-store)
    * [`doc_values`](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/doc-values)

## 3.3. Sorting and Pagination.

## 3.4. Aggregations:

* **Bucket Aggregations:** `terms`, `range`, `date_histogram`, `nested`.
* **Metric Aggregations:** `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max`, `cardinality`, `stats`.
* Combining aggregations.

**Learning Activities:**

* Work through Query DSL examples in the documentation.
* Define custom mappings for your indices.
* Experiment with different analyzers to see how text is tokenized.
* Create complex queries combining multiple clauses.
* Build various aggregations on your sample data.

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 weeks

# Module 4: Elasticsearch Internals - Architecture & Data Handling ‚öôÔ∏è

**Goal:** Understand how Elasticsearch works under the hood.

## 4.1. Distributed Architecture:

* **Cluster Discovery & Master Election:** How nodes find each other and elect a master.

    <blockquote class="ykt">

    **Take a look**

    Elasticsearch defines a custom binary protocol for inter-node communication using Netty. Look at `org.elasticsearch.transport` package, especially [`TransportService`](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/main/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/transport/TransportService.java) and [`Netty4Transport`](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/main/modules/transport-netty4/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/transport/netty4/Netty4Transport.java).

* **Inverted Index:** The core data structure.
* **Segments:** How data is stored and managed in Lucene.
* **Commits & Translog:** Durability and data recovery.
* **Refresh, Flush, Merge:** Operations affecting data visibility and segment management.

## 4.3. Search Internals:

* **Query Execution Flow:** How a search request is processed across the cluster (scatter-gather).
* **Relevance & Scoring:**
    * TF-IDF (Term Frequency/Inverse Document Frequency) - conceptual understanding.
    * BM25 (Okapi BM25) - the default similarity algorithm.
